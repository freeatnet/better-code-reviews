# Better Code Reviews

A little website, trying to change how we think about code reviews in a big way!ðŸš€

## Roadmap
If you only have a few minutes to help out, you can take [the survey](https://vaidehi.typeform.com/to/tl7MX5) that is the basis for all of the code review data.

If you have more time to give: I'm looking for data scientists, graph nerds, and developers to help me analyze all this data and make this website prettier!

A rough set of TODOs/questions to answer:

- [ ] Do years of experience and opinions on code reviews have any correlation?
- [ ] Do programmers working in a particular language/framework spend more time on code reviews than others?
- [ ] Do programmers working in a particular language/framework require more reviewers than others?
- [ ] Do programmers working in a particular language/framework require more reviewers before merging a PR than others?
- [ ] What percentage of programmers do *not* use a Github-based pull request + review system?
- [ ] How much time, on average, do junior or entry-level developers spend reviewing a pull request? How much time do senior developers spend?
- [ ] How often do junior or entry-level developers have to make changes to their PR's? And how often do senior developers have to do the same?
- [ ] What percentage of senior or expereinced developers merge their PR's without having *anyone* else review them?
